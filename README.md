# Pizza Sales SQL Analysis Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze pizza sales data using SQL to understand customer ordering patterns, revenue distribution, top-selling pizza types, and overall business performance. The insights from this analysis can help improve marketing strategies, menu optimization, staffing, and inventory management.

## Business Problem
The pizza store wants to identify:
- Which pizzas generate the highest revenue  
- Which pizza sizes and categories are most popular  
- At what times customers place the most orders  
- How ordering patterns vary by day  
- Which pizza types contribute the most to total sales  

Understanding these factors will help the business improve operational efficiency and increase overall revenue.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains multiple relational tables, commonly including:

- **Orders** – each order placed  
- **Order Details** – pizzas and quantities in each order  
- **Pizza Types** – names, categories, ingredients  
- **Pizza Information** – size, price  

This structure allows performing joins, aggregations, and advanced SQL analysis similar to real-world retail data.
